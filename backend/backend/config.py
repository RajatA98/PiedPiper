# --- audio encoder (ADR-0002: swap LAION-CLAP → MuQ-MuLan) -------------------
#
# MuQ-MuLan is a CLIP-style music-text joint embedder (~700M params) from
# Tencent AI Lab, January 2025 SOTA on MagnaTagATune zero-shot tagging.
# We use it for both similarity (audio path) and zero-shot genre tagging
# (text path), so a single model load powers both jobs.
#
# Sample rate: 24 kHz (LAION-CLAP was 48 kHz). The encoder resamples inputs
# internally so callers can pass any sr — but the runtime cost favors sending
# audio at the target rate when possible.
